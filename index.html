                        Welcome to my personal website!  My name is Benjamin Yanick and I have a passion for self-learning.
                        This website is a showcase of the projects I have developed over the years.  The website currently presents 3D artwork I've made with Blender and web development projects.  Eventually, projects related to AI and electronics will be included.

                <p>
                    Web development is a rapidly growing field of programming, since it is used almost everywhere.  The internet has become so ingrained in modern society that the need for a web presence is mandatory.  Being able to build websites for businesses/entrepreneurs is a valuable skill to have.  I primarily focus on front-end development but am taking a liking to back-end development thanks to Flask with Python.  Despite the small bit of Vue.js used to include the pictures on this site, everything is coded using vanilla HTML/CSS and JavaScript.

                <h3>Landing Page</h3>
                <p>
                    A clone of the Chrome extension, <i>Momentum</i>, which displays the current time along with an image based on the time of day, gathered using JavaScript.  For example, in the project link we see the sun starting to set since the time of day is in the afternoon.  Additionally, you can type your name and a focus of the day, which your browser will remeber and display, even if you try to refresh the page (to revert this you actually need to clear your browser's cache).

                <h3>Slideshow</h3>
                <p>
                    A powerpoint like slideshow that displays five different images and some dummy text that is associated with each image.  The slideshow "animation" gives the impression of the project spanning multiple pages but it is really just hiding and unhiding images given the current position within the slide show.  The animation is done with CSS while navigation between images is handled with JavaScript.  Note there is also a auto scrolling button at the top that will automatically change to the next slide every 5 seconds, this timer resets if the user manually changes slides.

                <h3>Gallery</h3>
                <p>
                    A image gallery for eight tech-themed images with eight blocks of dummy text, each assigned to a specific image.  This uses a small bit of CSS to get fading effects and, JavaScript to change the current image to the one the user selected along with displaying the proper text block.  This project is similar to the slideshow above yet, the jumping between images in any random order is what makes this more challenging to solve.

                <h3>Ray Casting</h3>
                <p>
                    A simple ray casting engine, based on a YoutTube video by Coding Train.  The engine works by calculating the distance between the closest boundry to the point light source.  A white line, representing a light ray, is projected from the point light to the boundry, giving the impression of a ray of light shining from the point source to the boundry. This engine has also been extended with movement controls (only on Desktop) using <i>WASD</i> and movement speed buttons (both mobile and desktop) for the light source.  Also, user defined boundaries can be placed on screen to effect the rays being casted by the light source.

                    <strong>NOTE:</strong>  For mobile devices, click in two spots on the screen to select a starting and end point for your boundaries.  For desktop, click and drag to place your boundaries.

                <p>
                    A small UI project where the user can click the previous and next buttons to transition between different elements within the nobel gas group.  A small navigation bar shows up to which nobel gas they are currently on (highlighted in light teal).  Users can also click on the gas navigational dot within the bar to jump to a specific element, rather than click next or previous repeatedly.  When a element is selected, a small "fun fact" bit of information is displayed above the nav bar.

                <p>
                    One of the more non-scientific topics of my self-learning adventure, 3D modeling
                    is more for relaxing than anything else.  Blender is a powerful open-source 3D
                    modeling software that is a lot more forgiving than painting/drawing similar models.

                <h3>Rings</h3>
                <p>
                    A scene I made towards the beginning of my time with Blender.  I duplicated a ring multiple
                    times, changing its size and orientation each time. I have the rings wrap around the core and,
                    a single light shining down on them.

                <h3>Train</h3>
                <p>
                    This train was modeled after a image of a train I saw on google, while practicing with shape
                    manipulation in Blender.  All of the pieces to this train are made with primitive objects, meaning
                    that no sculpting or object editing was performed.  This is a crude way to model but suffices as a
                    starting point into modeling.

                <h3>Boat Under the Moonlight</h3>
                <p>
                    This scene does not set out to be over complicated or involve too much.  I
                    created a simple, low-poly model of a boat and, placed it out on a plane with a reflective
                    dark-blue material.  The white spheres in the sky emit their own light, which is how they
                    create reflections on the water.  This image was rendered with Blender's Cycles rendering
                    engine.

                <h3>The Docks</h3>
                <p>
                    A low-poly docks where the wooden planks have cuts and distortions to their shape slightly to give a more "realistic" look, since very uniformed planks would look off.
                    This was rendered using the Eevee engine, which is Blender's real time rendering engine.  This means that the image is created in a few seconds because the engine makes a few
                    "shortcuts" when it comes to rendering reflections, light bounces, etc. .

                <p>
                    The start to a future series of low-poly landscapes that I want to create.  These scenes will use rough sculpting of primitive objects to create the land features (i.e. rives, mountains, etc.).
                    The Eevee rendering engine will be used to help enhance the cartoon-ish look of these landscapes, which is a key part to their character.

                <p>
                    A recreation of the iconic childhood toys, Legos.  The main focus is on realism with the lighting and texturing of the scene.  This project uses the Cycles rendering engine to
                    achieve the most realistic lighting options.  I have some future ideas of creating buildings and other sturctures with the basic Lego building blocks seen here.

                <h3>Hammer</h3>
                <p>
                    The closest I have gotten, so far, to photorealism within Blender.  Ironically, this image was captured using the Eevee engine.  The repeating ring pattern down the texture of the wooden handle
                    slightly suppresses the realism of the image, I think, since this is too uniform for the real world.  Changing the ring pattern would require dealing with UV unwrapping of the image texture, which
                    is above my level of experience with Blender at the time of rendering the image.
