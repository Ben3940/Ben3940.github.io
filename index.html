                            I created a simple clone of the desktop calculator app that you will find
                            on any computer.  You can do basic arithmetic operations (i.e. add,
                            subtract, multiply, and divide), factorial, exponential, and store numbers in
                            temporary memory by using the M keys to the far right.  Coded in C++ with the
                            use of the Qt widget toolkit to make the GUI easier to develop.

                            the file content.  Coded in C++ with the use of the Qt framework to accelerate
                            development of the GUI.

                            I also use Bootstrap 4 (CSS framework) and Vue.js (JavaScript framework) to make
                            the website more stylized and responsive.  This website is continously expanding as

                            in this chrome extension.

                                AI is rapidly growing and continuously opens up many new doors to the scientific community.
                                I am particulary intested in neural networks and computer vision, however, I find myself hoping around
                                from one AI model to the next.  Python and the various libraries (i.e. Scikit-learn and Keras)
                                geared towards AI development make it a blast to program AI.

                        <p>
                            This AI is given a review of a park and predicts if the review is positive or negative,
                            given the words used in the sentence.  This AI uses naive Bayes' theorem as its model.  To train
                            the model, it was given 2000 positive review and 2000 negative reviews.  It then tokenized each word
                            from every positive sentence and determined the probability of a word being associated with positivity.
                            For example, if the word "good" appeared more often than "ok" in the positive reivews, then "good" will
                            lead to a higher probability of a sentence being positive, given that the word "good" is in it.  The AI
                            will tokenize the negative reviews the same way.  At the end, the AI will ask if its prediction was correct,
                            giving you the chance to teach it and help it improve its model.

                            This AI will play tic tac toe with you.  It will always tie or beat you in every game, it can never lose.  It uses
                            a Minimax algroithm to predict every move that can be made.  By doing so, the AI can evaluate which
                            set of moves will direct it towards the optimal outcome.  For tic tac toe, there are not that many moves
                            to consider, however, the AI takes much longer to make its first move than it does it second to last, because
                            there are less moves it has to consider.

                            The A, B, C, and D, keys on the keypad were programmed as the add, subtract, multiply, and

                                One of the more non-scientific topics of my self-learning adventure, 3D modeling
                                is more for relaxing than anything else.  Blender is a powerful open-source 3D
                                modeling software that is a lot more forgiving than painting/drawing similar models.

                            A scene I made towards the beginning of my time with Blender.  I duplicated a ring multiple
                            times, changing its size and orientation each time. I have the rings wrap around the core and,
                            a singe light shining down on them.

                        <p>
                            This train was modeled after a image of a train I saw on google, while practicing with shape
                            manipulation in Blender.  All of the pieces to this train are made with primitive objects, meaning
                            that no sculpting or object editing was performed.  This is a crude way to model but suffices as a
                            starting point into modeling.

                        <p>
                            This scene does not set out to be over complicated or involve too much.  I
                            created a simple, low-poly model of a boat and, placed it out on a plane with a reflective
                            dark-blue material.  The white spheres in the sky emit their own light, which is how they
                            create reflections on the water.  This image was rendered with Blender's Cycles rendering
                            engine.
