                        Welcome to my personal website!  My name is Benjamin Yanick and I have a passion for self-learning.
                        This website is a showcase of the projects I have developed over the years.  The website currently presents 3D artwork I've made with Blender and web development projects.  Eventually, projects related to AI and electronics will be included.

                <h1>Web Development</h1>
                <p>
                    Web development is a rapidly growing field of programming, since it is used almost everywhere.  The internet has become so ingrained in modern society that the need for a web presence is mandatory.  Being able to build websites for businesses/entrepreneurs is a valuable skill to have.  I primarily focus on front-end development but am taking a liking to back-end development thanks to Flask with Python.  Despite the small bit of Vue.js used to include the pictures on this site, everything is coded using vanilla HTML/CSS and JavaScript.

                <h3>Landing Page</h3>
                <p>
                    A clone of the Chrome extension, <i>Momentum</i>, which displays the current time along with an image based on the time of day, gathered using JavaScript.  For example, in the project link we see the sun starting to set since the time of day is in the afternoon.  Additionally, you can type your name and a focus of the day, which your browser will remeber and display, even if you try to refresh the page (to revert this you actually need to clear your browser's cache).

                <h3>Slideshow</h3>
                <p>
                    A powerpoint like slideshow that displays five different images and some dummy text that is associated with each image.  The slideshow "animation" gives the impression of the project spanning multiple pages but it is really just hiding and unhiding images given the current position within the slide show.  The animation is done with CSS while navigation between images is handled with JavaScript.  Note there is also a auto scrolling button at the top that will automatically change to the next slide every 5 seconds, this timer resets if the user manually changes slides.

                <h3>Ray Casting</h3>
                <p>
                    A simple ray casting engine, based on a YoutTube video by Coding Train.  The engine works by calculating the distance between the closest boundry to the point light source.  A white line, representing a light ray, is projected from the point light to the boundry, giving the impression of a ray of light shining from the point source to the boundry. This engine has also been extended with movement controls (only on Desktop) using <i>WASD</i> and movement speed buttons (both mobile and desktop) for the light source.  Also, user defined boundaries can be placed on screen to effect the rays being casted by the light source.

                    Click on the image to see the project in action.

                    <strong>NOTE:</strong>  For mobile devices, click in two spots on the screen to select a start and end point for your boundaries.  For desktop, click and drag to place your boundaries.

                <h3>Incremental Progress</h3>
                <p>
                    A small UI project where the user can click the previous and next buttons to transition between different elements within the nobel gas group.  A small navigation bar shows up to which nobel gas they are currently on (highlighted in light teal).  Users can also click on the gas navigational dot within the bar to jump to a specific element, rather than click next or previous repeatedly.  When a element is selected, a small "fun fact" bit of information is displayed above the nav bar.

                <h3>Dining Menu (With React.js)</h3>
                <p>
                    A simple menu app that displays different options to order.  The menu can be filtered based on a selected category (i.e. all, lunch, etc.).  The menu is dynamically created using React.js making this the first project to not use vanilla JavaScript.  A "order" component can allow the user to see which items they have ordered, what the price of each item is, their current told, and if they would like to remove any items from their order.

                    <b>NOTE:</b> To see the full application in action, view on a desktop with a screen size of 1,600px+ (order component is disabled on screen sizes smaller than this)

                <p>
                    One of the more non-scientific topics of my self-learning adventure, 3D modeling
                    is more for relaxing than anything else.  Blender is a powerful open-source 3D
                    modeling software that is a lot more forgiving than painting/drawing similar models.
