            Welcome to my personal website! My name is Benjamin Yanick and I
            have a passion for self-learning. This website is a showcase of the
            projects I have developed over the years. The website currently
            presents 3D artwork I've made with Blender and web development
            projects. Eventually, projects related to AI and electronics will be
            included.

            <h1>Web Development</h1>
            <p>
              Web development is a rapidly growing field of programming, since
              it is used almost everywhere. The internet has become so ingrained
              in modern society that the need for a web presence is mandatory.
              Being able to build websites for businesses/entrepreneurs is a
              valuable skill to have. I primarily focus on front-end development
              but am taking a liking to back-end development thanks to Flask
              with Python. Despite the small bit of Vue.js used to include the
              pictures on this site, everything is coded using vanilla HTML/CSS
              and JavaScript.

            <h3>Ray Casting</h3>
            <p>
              A simple ray casting engine, based on a YoutTube video by Coding
              Train. The engine works by calculating the distance between the
              closest boundry to the point light source. A white line,
              representing a light ray, is projected from the point light to the
              boundry, giving the impression of a ray of light shining from the
              point source to the boundry. This engine has also been extended
              with movement controls (only on Desktop) using <i>WASD</i> and
              movement speed buttons (both mobile and desktop) for the light
              source. Also, user defined boundaries can be placed on screen to
              effect the rays being casted by the light source. <br /><br />
              Click on the image to see the project in action.
              <br /><br />
              <strong>NOTE:</strong> For mobile devices, click in two spots on
              the screen to select a start and end point for your boundaries.
              For desktop, click and drag to place your boundaries.

            <h3>Incremental Progress</h3>
            <p>
              A small UI project where the user can click the previous and next
              buttons to transition between different elements within the nobel
              gas group. A small navigation bar shows up to which nobel gas they
              are currently on (highlighted in light teal). Users can also click
              on the gas navigational dot within the bar to jump to a specific
              element, rather than click next or previous repeatedly. When a
              element is selected, a small "fun fact" bit of information is
              displayed above the nav bar.

            <h3>Dining Menu (With React.js)</h3>
            <p>
              A simple menu app that displays different options to order. The
              menu can be filtered based on a selected category (i.e. all,
              lunch, etc.). The menu is dynamically created using React.js
              making this the first project to not use vanilla JavaScript. A
              "order" component can allow the user to see which items they have
              ordered, what the price of each item is, their current told, and
              if they would like to remove any items from their order.

            <p>
              A UI for a team/project managment software application.
              Projects/teams (refered to as "cards" from here on) are displayed
              in the center of the screen and can be clicked to focus on that
              card. Focused cards will have additional info to display to the
              user. A sidebar, to the left, will display all active cards, which
              can be selected to focus a particular card this way.

            <p>
              One of the more non-scientific topics of my self-learning
              adventure, 3D modeling is more for relaxing than anything else.
              Blender is a powerful open-source 3D modeling software that is a
              lot more forgiving than painting/drawing similar models.
