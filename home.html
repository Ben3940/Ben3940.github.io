                        Welcome to my personal website!  My name is Benjamin Yanick and I have a passion for self-learning.
                        This website is a showcase of the projects I have developed over the years.  The website
                        is broken down into sections related to programming, web development, AI, electronics,
                        and 3D modeling.  You can scroll down or click the links in the navigation bar above.

                <p>
                    One of the more non-scientific topics of my self-learning adventure, 3D modeling
                    is more for relaxing than anything else.  Blender is a powerful open-source 3D
                    modeling software that is a lot more forgiving than painting/drawing similar models.

                <h3>Rings</h3>
                <p>
                    A scene I made towards the beginning of my time with Blender.  I duplicated a ring multiple
                    times, changing its size and orientation each time. I have the rings wrap around the core and,
                    a single light shining down on them.

                <h3>Train</h3>
                <p>
                    This train was modeled after a image of a train I saw on google, while practicing with shape
                    manipulation in Blender.  All of the pieces to this train are made with primitive objects, meaning
                    that no sculpting or object editing was performed.  This is a crude way to model but suffices as a
                    starting point into modeling.

                <h3>Boat Under the Moonlight</h3>
                <p>
                    This scene does not set out to be over complicated or involve too much.  I
                    created a simple, low-poly model of a boat and, placed it out on a plane with a reflective
                    dark-blue material.  The white spheres in the sky emit their own light, which is how they
                    create reflections on the water.  This image was rendered with Blender's Cycles rendering
                    engine.

                <h3>The Docks</h3>
                <p>
                    A low-poly docks where the wooden planks have cuts and distortions to their shape slightly to give a more "realistic" look, since very uniformed planks would look off.
                    This was rendered using the Eevee engine, which is Blender's real time rendering engine.  This means that the image is created in a few seconds because the engine makes a few
                    "shortcuts" when it comes to rendering reflections, light bounces, etc. .

                <h3>The Vally</h3>
                <p>
                    The start to a future series of low-poly landscapes that I want to create.  These scenes will use rough sculpting of primitive objects to create the land features (i.e. rives, mountains, etc.).
                    The Eevee rendering engine will be used to help enhance the cartoon-ish look of these landscapes, which is a key part to their character.

                <h3>Legos</h3>
                <p>
                    A recreation of the iconic childhood toys, Legos.  The main focus is on realism with the lighting and texturing of the scene.  This project uses the Cycles rendering engine to
                    achieve the most realistic lighting options.  I have some future ideas of creating buildings and other sturctures with the basic Lego building blocks seen here.

                <h3>Hammer</h3>
                <p>
                    The closest I have gotten, so far, to photorealism within Blender.  Ironically, this image was captured using the Eevee engine.  The repeating ring pattern down the texture of the wooden handle
                    slightly suppresses the realism of the image, I think, since this is too uniform for the real world.  Changing the ring pattern would require dealing with UV unwrapping of the image texture, which
                    is above my level of experience with Blender at the time of rendering the image.
