                        Welcome to my personal website!  My name is Benjamin Yanick and I have a passion for self-learning.
                        This website is a showcase of the projects I have developed over the years.  The website
                        is broken down into sections related to programming, web development, AI, electronics,
                        and 3D modeling.  You can scroll down or click the links in the navigation bar above.

                    Being able to create websites in order to display data (i.e. products, accomplishments,
                    information, etc.) is essential in modern society.  I really enjoy front-end development
                    and working with HTML/CSS and JavaScript to create responsive and stylish websites for the
                    various forms of data to be displayed on the internet.

                <h5>This Website</h5>
                <p>
                    This entire website was created from the ground up using HTML/CSS and JavaScript.
                    I also use Bootstrap 4 (CSS framework) and Vue.js (JavaScript framework) to make
                    the website more stylized and responsive.  This website is continously expanding as
                    I set out to learn more and add previous projects to the website.  Therefore,
                    more languages, frameworks, and optimizations may be added to the site in the future.

                <h5>Landing Page</h5>
                <p>
                    This is a clone of the chrome extension called Momentum.  This web page will set the time (while continuously updating
                    it) with respect to the user's system time.  It will also store in local storage the user's name and their focus
                    for that day, displaying the information provided back even if the browser is refreshed.  Despite the small use of Bootstrap
                    to make positioning of the text on mobile devices more appealing, vanilla HTML/CSS and JavaScript are the only things used 
                    in this chrome extension.

                    You can click on the image to see the extension in action.
